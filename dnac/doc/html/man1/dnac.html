<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>dnac - DTN node auto-configuration</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>dnac</b> [ <i>node_list_dir_name</i> [ <i>node_nbr</i> [ <i>path_name</i> [ <i>host_name</i> [ <i>password_path_name</i> ] ] ] ] ]</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><b>dnac</b> is a utility program for automatically configuring and deploying a new ION node. The new node is instantiated within the directory identified by <i>path_name</i> as an additional node on the same machine as the node within which <b>dnac</b> is running; after instantiation, the new node may either be started on that machine or else automatically relocated to another machine and started there.</p>

<p>Node instantiation is accomplished by first configuring the local (&quot;parent&quot; or &quot;sponsor&quot;) node for communication with the new node, then announcing to the home region the parent node&#39;s impending contacts with the new node. Then standard ION configuration files are constructed in the instantiation directory; default values for all configuration parameters are provided by <b>dnac</b> but may be supplemented (or in some cases overridden) by select parameters provided in user-written ION configuration files pre-placed in the instantiation directory.</p>

<p>Then ION administration utilities are executed to create the new node by consuming those configuration files, after which an instance of the <b>dnacc</b> utility is spawned for the new node.</p>

<p><b>dnacc</b> generates the new node&#39;s public/private key pair, stores the new private key in encrypted representation (as enabled by the passphrase in the file identified by <i>password_path_name</i>), and sends the public key back to <b>dnac</b>. <b>dnac</b> submits the new public key to the DTKA public key authority (signed in the parent node&#39;s own private key) and starts the new node, either on the local machine or after copying the node&#39;s state (its SDR heap file) to the remote machine identified by <i>host_name</i>.</p>

<p>Configures and deploys a new node in the ../newnode directory; the multi-node deployment will be subject to the <b>ion_nodes</b> file in the current working directory (i.e., ION_NODE_LIST_DIR will be set to &quot;.&quot;). The new node&#39;s number will be automatically generated as the concatenation of the local node&#39;s home region number and the current DTN time. The node&#39;s configuration will include items from the &quot;spec&quot; configuration files in ../newnode, if any, and the new node&#39;s private key will be encrypted using the passphrase in ../secure/passwd. The node will not be automatically relocated to any other computer.</p>

<h1 id="FILES">FILES</h1>

<p><b>dnac</b> will create a file named &quot;node.ionrc&quot; that will be passed to ionadmin.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> will execute &quot;briefing&quot; commands to create orientation files for the new node. The file named &quot;contacts.<b>regionNbr</b>.ionrc&quot; will contain commands to load all contacts in the contact plan for the home region of the node at which <b>dnac</b> is being run. The file named &quot;passageways.<b>regionNbr</b>.ionrc&quot; will contain commands to load all passageway information known to this node. The file named &quot;ranges.ionrc&quot; will contain commands to load all range information known to this node. All three files will be passed to ionadmin.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> will create a file named &quot;node.ionconfig&quot; that will be referenced by the node initialization command in the node.ionrc file. The default values written to this file may be overridden by user-selected values noted in a file named &quot;spec.ionconfig&quot;.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> will create a file named &quot;node.ionsecrc&quot; that will be passed to ionsecadmin. The commands written to this file may be supplemented by user-written commands noted in a file named &quot;spec.ionsecrc&quot;.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> may create a file named &quot;node.ltprc&quot; that will be passed to ltpadmin. The commands written to this file may be supplemented by user-written commands noted in a file named &quot;spec.ltprc&quot;.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> may create a file named &quot;node.bssprc&quot; that will be passed to bsspadmin. The commands written to this file may be supplemented by user-written commands noted in a file named &quot;spec.bssprc&quot;.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> will create a file named &quot;node.bprc&quot; that will be passed to bpadmin. The commands written to this file may be supplemented by user-written commands noted in a file named &quot;spec.bprc&quot;.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> will create a file named &quot;node.tccrc&quot; that will be passed to tccadmin. The commands written to this file may be supplemented by user-written commands noted in a file named &quot;spec.tccrc&quot;.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> will create a file named &quot;node.dtkarc&quot; that will be passed to dtkaadmin. The commands written to this file may be supplemented by user-written commands noted in a file named &quot;spec.dtkarc&quot;.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> may create a file named &quot;node.cfdprc&quot; that will be passed to cfdpadmin. The commands written to this file may be supplemented by user-written commands noted in a file named &quot;spec.cfdprc&quot;.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> will create a file named &quot;ionstart&quot; that will be executed as a script to start the new node and to restart it after it has been stopped.</p>

<p><b>dnac</b> will create a file named &quot;ionstop&quot; that can later be executed as a script to stop the new node.</p>
