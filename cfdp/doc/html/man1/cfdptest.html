<p>cfdptest - CFDP test shell for ION</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>cfdptest</b> [ <i>commands_filename</i> ]</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><b>cfdptest</b> provides a mechanism for testing CFDP file transmission. It can be used in either scripted or interactive mode. All bundles containing CFDP PDUs are sent with custody transfer requested and with all bundle status reporting disabled.</p>

<p>When scripted with <i>commands_filename</i>, <b>cfdptest</b> operates in response to CFDP management commands contained in the provided commands file. Each line of text in the file is interpreted as a single command comprising several tokens: a one-character command code and, in most cases, one or more command arguments of one or more characters. The commands configure and initiate CFDP file transmission operations.</p>

<p>If no file is specified, <b>cfdptest</b> instead offers the user an interactive &quot;shell&quot; for command entry. <b>cfdptest</b> prints a prompt string (&quot;: &quot;) to stdout, accepts strings of text from stdin, and interprets each string as a command.</p>

<p>The supported <b>cfdptest</b> commands (whether interactive or scripted) are as follows:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="pod"><b>?</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>help</b> command. This will display a listing of the commands and their formats. It is the same as the <b>h</b> command.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="h"><b>h</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>An alternate form of the <b>help</b> command.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="z-number-of-seconds-to-pause"><b>z</b> [&lt;number of seconds to pause&gt;]</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>pause</b> command. When <b>cfdptest</b> is running in interactive mode, this command causes the console input processing thread to pause the indicated number of seconds (defaulting to 1) before processing the next command. This is provided for use in test scripting.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="d-destination-CFDP-entity-ID-number"><b>d</b> &lt;destination CFDP entity ID number&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>destination</b> command. This command establishes the CFDP entity to which the next file transmission operation will be directed. CFDP entity numbers in ION are, by convention, the same as BP node numbers.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="f-source-file-path-name"><b>f</b> &lt;source file path name&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>from</b> command. This command identifies the file that will be transmitted when the next file transmission operation is commanded.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="t-destination-file-path-name"><b>t</b> &lt;destination file path name&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>to</b> command. This command provides the name for the file that will be created at the receiving entity when the next file transmission operation is commanded.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="l-lifetime-in-seconds"><b>l</b> &lt;lifetime in seconds&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>time-to-live</b> command. This command establishes the time-to-live for all subsequently issued bundles containing CFDP PDUs. If not specified, the default value 86400 (1 day) is used.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="p-priority"><b>p</b> &lt;priority&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>priority</b> command. This command establishes the priority (class of service) for all subsequently issued bundles containing CFDP PDUs. Valid values are 0, 1, and 2. If not specified, priority is 1.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="o-ordinal"><b>o</b> &lt;ordinal&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>ordinal</b> command. This command establishes the &quot;ordinal&quot; (sub-priority within priority 2) for all subsequently issued bundles containing CFDP PDUs. Valid values are 0-254. If not specified, ordinal is 0.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="m-mode"><b>m</b> &lt;mode&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>mode</b> command. This command establishes the transmission mode (&quot;best-effort&quot; or assured) for all subsequently issued bundles containing CFDP PDUs. Valid values are 0 (assured, reliable, with reliability provided by a reliable DTN convergence layer protocol), 1 (best-effort, unreliable), and 2 (assured, reliable, but with reliability provided by BP custody transfer). If not specified, transmission mode is 0.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="a-latency-in-seconds"><b>a</b> &lt;latency in seconds&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>closure latency</b> command. This command establishes the transaction closure latency for all subsequent file transmission operations. When it is set to zero, the file transmission is &quot;open loop&quot; and the CFDP transaction at the sending entity finishes when the EOF is sent. Otherwise, the receiving CFDP entity is being asked to send a &quot;Finished&quot; PDU back to the sending CFDP entity when the transaction finishes at the receiving entity. Normally the transaction finishes at the sending entity only when that Finished PDU is received. However, when <i>closure latency</i> seconds elapse following transmission of the EOF PDU prior to receipt of the Finished PDU, the transaction finishes immediately with a Check Timer fault.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="n-0-1"><b>n</b> { 0 | 1 }</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>segment metadata</b> command. This command controls the insertion of sample segment metadata -- a string representation of the current time -- in every file data segment PDU. A value of 1 enables segment metadata insertion, while a value of 0 disables it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="g-srrflags"><b>g</b> &lt;srrflags&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>srrflags</b> command. This command establishes the BP status reporting that will be requested for all subsequently issued bundles containing CFDP PDUs. <i>srrflags</i> must be a status reporting flags string as defined for bptrace(1): a sequence of status report flags, separated by commas, with no embedded whitespace. Each status report flag must be one of the following: rcv, ct, fwd, dlv, del.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="c-criticality"><b>c</b> &lt;criticality&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>criticality</b> command. This command establishes the criticality for all subsequently issued bundles containing CFDP PDUs. Valid values are 0 (not critical) and 1 (critical). If not specified, criticality is 0.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="r-action-code-nbr-first-path-name-second-path-name"><b>r</b> &lt;action code nbr&gt; &lt;first path name&gt; &lt;second path name&gt;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>filestore request</b> command. This command adds a filestore request to the metadata that will be issued when the next file transmission operation is commanded. Action code numbers are:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="create-file">0 = create file</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="delete-file">1 = delete file</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="rename-file">2 = rename file</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="append-file">3 = append file</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="replace-file">4 = replace file</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="create-directory">5 = create directory</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="remove-directory">6 = remove directory</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="deny-file">7 = deny file</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="deny-directory">8 = deny directory</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
<dt id="u-message-text"><b>u</b> &#39;&lt;message text&gt;&#39;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>user message</b> command. This command adds a user message to the metadata that will be issued when the next file transmission operation is commanded.</p>

</dd>
<dt id=""><b>&amp;</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>send</b> command. This command initiates file transmission as configured by the most recent preceding <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>a</b> commands.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod1"><b>|</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>get</b> command. This command causes a request for file transmission to the local node, subject to the parameters provided by the most recent preceding <b>f</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>a</b> commands, to be sent to the entity identified by the most recent preceding <b>d</b> command.</p>

<p><b>NOTE</b> that &#39;get&#39; in CFDP is implemented very differently from &#39;send&#39;. The &#39;send&#39; operation is a native element of the CFDP protocol. The &#39;get&#39; operation is implemented by sending to the responding entity a standardized sequence of message-to-user messages in a Metadata PDU - the <i>user application</i> at the responding entity receives those messages and initiates a &#39;send&#39; to accomplish transmission of the file. This means that &#39;send&#39; can succeed even if no user application is running at the remote node, but &#39;get&#39; cannot.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod2"><b>^</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>cancel</b> command. This command cancels the most recently initiated file transmission.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod3"><b>%</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>suspend</b> command. This command suspends the most recently initiated file transmission.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod4"><b>$</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>resume</b> command. This command resumes the most recently initiated file transmission.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod5"><b>#</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>report</b> command. This command reports on the most recently initiated file transmission.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="q"><b>q</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>quit</b> command. Terminates the cfdptest program.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>cfdptest</b> in interactive mode also spawns a CFDP event handling thread. The event thread receives CFDP service indications and simply prints lines of text to stdout to announce them.</p>

<p><b>NOTE</b> that when <b>cfdptest</b> runs in scripted mode it does <b>not</b> spawn an event handling thread, which makes it possible for the CFDP events queue to grow indefinitely unless some other task consumes and reports on the events. One simple solution is to run an interactive <b>cfdptest</b> task in background, simply to keep the event queue cleared, while scripted non-interactive <b>cfdptest</b> tasks are run in the foreground.</p>
