<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The BSS library supports the streaming of data over delay-tolerant networking (DTN) bundles. The intent of the library is to enable applications that pass streaming data received in transmission time order (i.e., without time regressions) to an application-specific &quot;display&quot; function -- notionally for immediate real-time display -- but to store <b>all</b> received data (including out-of-order data) in a private database for playback under user control. The reception and real-time display of in-order data is performed by a background thread, leaving the application&#39;s main (foreground) thread free to respond to user commands controlling playback or other application-specific functions.</p>

<p>The application-specific &quot;display&quot; function invoked by the background thread must conform to the RTBHandler type definition. It must return 0 on success, -1 on any error that should terminate the background thread. Only on return from this function will the background thread proceed to acquire the next BSS payload.</p>

<p>All data acquired by the BSS background thread is written to a BSS database comprising three files: table, list, and data. The name of the database is the root name that is common to the three files, e.g., <i>db3</i>.tbl, <i>db3</i>.lst, <i>db3</i>.dat would be the three files making up the <i>db3</i> BSS database. All three files of the selected BSS database must reside in the same directory of the file system.</p>

<p>Several replay navigation functions in the BSS library require that the application provide a navigation state structure of type bssNav as defined in the bss.h header file. The application is not reponsible for populating this structure; it&#39;s strictly for the private use of the BSS library.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="int-bssOpen-char-bssName-char-path-char-eid">int bssOpen(char *bssName, char *path, char *eid)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Opens access to a BSS database, to enable data playback. <i>bssName</i> identifies the specific BSS database that is to be opened. <i>path</i> identifies the directory in which the database resides. <i>eid</i> is ignored. On any failure, returns -1. On success, returns zero.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="int-bssStart-char-bssName-char-path-char-eid-char-buffer-int-bufLen-RTBHandler-handler">int bssStart(char *bssName, char *path, char *eid, char *buffer, int bufLen, RTBHandler handler)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Starts a BSS data acquisition background thread. <i>bssName</i> identifies the BSS database into which data will be acquired. <i>path</i> identifies the directory in which that database resides. <i>eid</i> is used to open the BP endpoint at which the delivered BSS bundle payload contents will be acquired. <i>buffer</i> identifies a data acquisition buffer, which must be provided by the application, and <i>bufLen</i> indicates the length of that buffer; received bundle payloads in excess of this length will be discarded.</p>

<p><i>handler</i> identifies the display function to which each in-order bundle payload will be passed. The <i>time</i> and <i>count</i> parameters passed to this function identify the received bundle, indicating the bundle&#39;s creation timestamp time (in seconds) and counter value. The <i>buffer</i> and <i>bufLength</i> parameters indicate the location into which the bundle&#39;s payload was acquired and the length of the acquired payload. <i>handler</i> must return -1 on any unrecoverable system error, 0 otherwise. A return value of -1 from <i>handler</i> will terminate the BSS data acquisition background thread.</p>

<p>On any failure, returns -1. On success, returns zero.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="int-bssRun-char-bssName-char-path-char-eid-char-buffer-int-bufLen-RTBHandler-handler">int bssRun(char *bssName, char *path, char *eid, char *buffer, int bufLen, RTBHandler handler)</dt>
<dd>

<p>A convenience function that performs both bssOpen() and bssStart(). On any failure, returns -1. On success, returns zero.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-bssClose">void bssClose()</dt>
<dd>

<p>Terminates data playback access to the most recently opened BSS database.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-bssStop">void bssStop()</dt>
<dd>

<p>Terminates the most recently initiated BSS data acquisition background thread.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-bssExit">void bssExit()</dt>
<dd>

<p>A convenience function that performs both bssClose() and bssStop().</p>

</dd>
<dt id="long-bssRead-bssNav-nav-char-data-int-dataLen">long bssRead(bssNav nav, char *data, int dataLen)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Copies the data at the current playback position in the database, as indicated by <i>nav</i>, into <i>data</i>; if the length of the data is in excess of <i>dataLen</i> then an error condition is asserted (i.e., -1 is returned). Note that bssRead() cannot be successfully called until <i>nav</i> has been populated, nominally by a preceding call to bssSeek(), bssNext(), or bssPrev(). Returns the length of data read, or -1 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="long-bssSeek-bssNav-nav-time_t-time-time_t-curTime-unsigned-long-count">long bssSeek(bssNav *nav, time_t time, time_t *curTime, unsigned long *count)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Sets the current playback position in the database, in <i>nav</i>, to the data received in the bundle with the earliest creation time that was greater than or equal to <i>time</i>. Populates <i>nav</i> and also returns the creation time and bundle ID count of that bundle in <i>curTime</i> and <i>count</i>. Returns the length of data at this location, or -1 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="long-bssSeek_read-bssNav-nav-time_t-time-time_t-curTime-unsigned-long-count-char-data-int-dataLen">long bssSeek_read(bssNav *nav, time_t time, time_t *curTime, unsigned long *count, char *data, int dataLen)</dt>
<dd>

<p>A convenience function that performs bssSeek() followed by an immediate bssRead() to return the data at the new playback position. Returns the length of data read, or -1 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="long-bssNext-bssNav-nav-time_t-curTime-unsigned-long-count">long bssNext(bssNav *nav, time_t *curTime, unsigned long *count)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Sets the playback position in the database, in <i>nav</i>, to the data received in the bundle with the earliest creation time and ID count greater than that of the bundle at the current playback position. Populates <i>nav</i> and also returns the creation time and bundle ID count of that bundle in <i>curTime</i> and <i>count</i>. Returns the length of data at this location (if any), -2 on reaching end of list, or -1 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="long-bssNext_read-bssNav-nav-time_t-curTime-unsigned-long-count-char-data-int-dataLen">long bssNext_read(bssNav *nav, time_t *curTime, unsigned long *count, char *data, int dataLen)</dt>
<dd>

<p>A convenience function that performs bssNext() followed by an immediate bssRead() to return the data at the new playback position. Returns the length of data read, -2 on reaching end of list, or -1 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="long-bssPrev-bssNav-nav-time_t-curTime-unsigned-long-count">long bssPrev(bssNav *nav, time_t *curTime, unsigned long *count)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Sets the playback position in the database, in <i>nav</i>, to the data received in the bundle with the latest creation time and ID count earlier than that of the bundle at the current playback position. Populates <i>nav</i> and also returns the creation time and bundle ID count of that bundle in <i>curTime</i> and <i>count</i>. Returns the length of data at this location (if any), -2 on reaching end of list, or -1 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="long-bssPrev_read-bssNav-nav-time_t-curTime-unsigned-long-count-char-data-int-dataLen">long bssPrev_read(bssNav *nav, time_t *curTime, unsigned long *count, char *data, int dataLen)</dt>
<dd>

<p>A convenience function that performs bssPrev() followed by an immediate bssRead() to return the data at the new playback position. Returns the length of data read, -2 on reaching end of list, or -1 on any error.</p>
