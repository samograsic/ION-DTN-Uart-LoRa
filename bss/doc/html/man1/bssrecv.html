<p>bssrecv - Bundle Streaming Service reception test program</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>bssrecv</b></p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> uses BSS to acquire streaming data from <b>bssStreamingApp</b>.</p>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> is a menu-driven interactive test program, run from the operating system shell prompt. The program enables the user to begin and end a session of BSS data acquisition from <b>bssStreamingApp</b>, displaying the data as it arrives in real time; to replay data acquired during the current session; and to replay data acquired during a prior session.</p>

<p>The user must provide values for three parameters in order to initiate the acquisition or replay of data from <b>bssStreamingApp</b>:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="BSS-database-name">BSS database name</dt>
<dd>

<p>All data acquired by the BSS session thread will be written to a BSS &quot;database&quot; comprising three files: table, list, and data. The name of the database is the root name that is common to the three files, e.g., <i>db3</i>.tbl, <i>db3</i>.lst, <i>db3</i>.dat would be the three files making up the <i>db3</i> BSS database.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="path-name">path name</dt>
<dd>

<p>All three files of the selected BSS database must reside in the same directory of the file system; the path name of that directory is required.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="endpoint-ID">endpoint ID</dt>
<dd>

<p>In order to acquire streaming data issued by <b>bssStreamingApp</b>, the <b>bssrecv</b> session thread must open the BP endpoint to which that data is directed. For this purpose, the ID of that endpoint is needed.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> offers the following menu options:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Open-BSS-Receiver-in-playback-mode">1. Open BSS Receiver in playback mode</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> prompts the user for the three parameter values noted above, then opens the indicated BSS database for replay of the data in that database.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Start-BSS-receiving-thread">2. Start BSS receiving thread</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> prompts the user for the three parameter values noted above, then starts a background session thread to acquire data into the indicated database. Each bundle that is acquired is passed to a display function that prints a single line consisting of N consecutive &#39;*&#39; characters, where N is computed as the data number at the start of the bundle&#39;s payload data, modulo 150. Note that the database is <b>not</b> open for replay at this time.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Run-BSS-receiver-thread">3. Run BSS receiver thread</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> prompts the user for the three parameter values noted above, then starts a background session thread to acquire data into the indicated database (displaying the data as described for option 2 above) and also opens the database for replay.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Close-current-playback-session">4. Close current playback session</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> closes the indicated BSS database, terminating replay access.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Stop-BSS-receiving-thread">5. Stop BSS receiving thread</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> terminates the current background session thread. Replay access to the BSS database, if currently open, is <b>not</b> terminated.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Stop-BSS-Receiver">6. Stop BSS Receiver</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> terminates the current background session thread. Replay access to the BSS database, if currently open, is also terminated.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Replay-session">7. Replay session</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> prompts the user for the start and end times bounding the reception interval that is to be replayed, then displays all data within that interval in both forward and reverse time order. The display function performed for this purpose is the same one that is exercised during real-time acquisition of streaming data.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Exit">8. Exit</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> terminates.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="EXIT-STATUS">EXIT STATUS</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="pod0">&quot;0&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bssrecv</b> has terminated.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="FILES">FILES</h1>

<p>No configuration files are needed.</p>

<h1 id="ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</h1>

<p>No environment variables apply.</p>
