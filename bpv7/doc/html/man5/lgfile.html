<p>lgfile - ION Load/Go source file</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The ION Load/Go system enables the execution of ION administrative programs at remote nodes:</p>

<ul>

<p>The <b>lgsend</b> program reads a Load/Go source file from a local file system, encapsulates the text of that source file in a bundle, and sends the bundle to a designated DTN endpoint on the remote node.</p>

<p>An <b>lgagent</b> task running on the remote node, which has opened that DTN endpoint for bundle reception, receives the extracted payload of the bundle -- the text of the Load/Go source file -- and processes it.</p>

</ul>

<p>Load/Go source file content is limited to newline-terminated lines of ASCII characters. More specifically, the text of any Load/Go source file is a sequence of <i>line sets</i> of two types: <i>file capsules</i> and <i>directives</i>. Any Load/Go source file may contain any number of file capsules and any number of directives, freely intermingled in any order, but the typical structure of a Load/Go source file is simply a single file capsule followed by a single directive.</p>

<p>Each <i>file capsule</i> is structured as a single start-of-capsule line, followed by zero or more capsule text lines, followed by a single end-of-capsule line. Each start-of-capsule line is of this form:</p>

<ul>

<p>[<i>file_name</i></p>

</ul>

<p>Each capsule text line can be any line of ASCII text that does not begin with an opening ([) or closing (]) bracket character.</p>

<p>A text line that begins with a closing bracket character (]) is interpreted as an end-of-capsule line.</p>

<p>A <i>directive</i> is any line of text that is not one of the lines of a file capsule and that is of this form:</p>

<ul>

<p>!<i>directive_text</i></p>

</ul>

<p>When <b>lgagent</b> identifies a file capsule, it copies all of the capsule&#39;s text lines to a new file named <i>file_name</i> that it creates in the current working directory. When <b>lgagent</b> identifies a directive, it executes the directive by passing <i>directive_text</i> to the pseudoshell() function (see platform(3)). <b>lgagent</b> processes the line sets of a Load/Go source file in the order in which they appear in the file, so the <i>directive_text</i> of a directive may reference a file that was created as the result of processing a prior file capsule line set in the same source file.</p>

<p>Note that lgfile directives are passed to pseudoshell(), which on a VxWorks platform will always spawn a new task; the first argument in <i>directive_text</i> must be a symbol that VxWorks can resolve to a function, not a shell command. Also note that the arguments in <i>directive_text</i> will be actual task arguments, not shell command-line arguments, so they should never be enclosed in double-quote characters (&quot;). However, any argument that contains embedded whitespace must be enclosed in single-quote characters (&#39;) so that pseudoshell() can parse it correctly.</p>

<h1 id="EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</h1>

<p>Presenting the following lines of source file text to <b>lgsend</b>:</p>

<ul>

<p>[cmd33.bprc</p>

<p>x protocol ltp</p>

<p>]</p>

<p>!bpadmin cmd33.bprc</p>

</ul>

<p>should cause the receiving node to halt the operation of the LTP convergence-layer protocol.</p>
