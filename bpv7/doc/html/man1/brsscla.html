<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>brsscla - BRSS-based BP convergence layer adapter (input and output) task</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>brsscla</b> <i>local_hostname</i>[:<i>local_port_nbr</i>]</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>BRSS is the &quot;server&quot; side of the Bundle Relay Service (BRS) convergence layer protocol for BP. It is complemented by BRSC, the &quot;client&quot; side of the BRS convergence layer protocol for BP.</p>

<p><b>brsscla</b> is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that spawns 2*N threads: one that handles BRSS client connections and spawns sockets for continued data interchange with connected clients; one that handles BRSS protocol output by transmitting over those spawned sockets to the associated clients; and two thread for each spawned socket, an input thread to handle BRSS protocol input from the associated connected client and an output thread to forward BRSS protocol output to the associated connected client.</p>

<p>The connection thread simply accepts connections on a TCP socket bound to <i>local_hostname</i> and <i>local_port_nbr</i> and spawns reception threads. The default value for <i>local_port_nbr</i>, if omitted, is 80.</p>

<p>Each reception thread receives over the socket connection the node number of the connecting client (in SDNV representation), followed by a 32-bit time tag and a 160-bit HMAC-SHA1 digest of that time tag. The receiving thread checks the time tag, requiring that it differ from the current time by no more than BRSTERM (default value 5) seconds. It then recomputes the digest value using the HMAC-SHA1 key named &quot;<i>node_number</i>.brs&quot; as recorded in the ION security database (see ionsecrc(5)), requiring that the supplied and computed digests be identical. If all registration conditions are met, the receiving thread sends the client a countersign -- a similarly computed HMAC-SHA1 digest, for the time tag that is 1 second later than the provided time tag -- to assure the client of its own authenticity, then commences receiving bundles over the connected socket. Each bundle received on the connection is preceded by its length, a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order. The received bundles are passed to the bundle protocol agent on the local ION node.</p>

<p>Each output thread extracts bundles from the queues of bundles ready for transmission via BRSS to the corresponding connected client and transmits the bundles over the socket to that client. Each transmitted bundle is preceded by its length, a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order.</p>

<p><b>brsscla</b> is spawned automatically by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to the &#39;s&#39; (START) command that starts operation of the Bundle Protocol, and it is terminated by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to an &#39;x&#39; (STOP) command. <b>brsscla</b> can also be spawned and terminated in response to START and STOP commands that pertain specifically to the BRSS convergence layer protocol.</p>

<h1 id="EXIT-STATUS">EXIT STATUS</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="pod0">&quot;0&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>brsscla</b> terminated normally, for reasons noted in the <b>ion.log</b> file. If this termination was not commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file and use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart the BRSS protocol.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod1">&quot;1&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>brsscla</b> terminated abnormally, for reasons noted in the <b>ion.log</b> file. Investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file, then use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart the BRSS protocol.</p>
