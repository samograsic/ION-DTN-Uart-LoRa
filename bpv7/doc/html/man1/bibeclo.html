<p>bibeclo - BP convergence layer output task using bundle-in-bundle encapsulation</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>bibeclo</b> <i>peer_EID</i> <i>destination_EID</i></p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><b>bibeclo</b> is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that extracts bundles from the queues of bundles destined for <i>destination_EID</i> that are ready for transmission via bundle-in-bundle encapsulation (BIBE) to <i>peer_EID</i>, encapsulates them in BP administrative records of (non-standard) record type 7 (BP_BIBE_PDU), and sends those administrative records in encapsulating bundles destined for <i>peer_EID</i>. The forwarding of encapsulated bundles for which custodial acknowledgment is requested causes <b>bibeclo</b> to post custodial re-forwarding timers to the node&#39;s timeline. Parameters governing the forwarding of BIBE PDUs to <i>peer_EID</i> are stipulated in the corresponding BIBE convergence-layer adapter (<b>bcla</b>) structure residing in the BIBE database, as managed by <b>bibeadmin</b>.</p>

<p>The receiving node is expected to process received BIBE PDUs by simply dispatching the encapsulated bundles - whose destination is the node identified by <i>destination_EID</i> - as if they had been received from neighboring nodes in the normal course of operations; BIBE PDUs for which custodial acknowledgment was requested cause the received bundles to be noted in custody signals that are being aggregated by the receiving node.</p>

<p><b>bibeclo</b> additionally sends aggregated custody signals in BP administrative records of (non-standard) record type 8 (BP_BIBE_SIGNAL) as the deadlines for custody signal transmission arrive.</p>

<p>Note that the reception and processing of both encapsulated bundles and custody signals is performed by the scheme-specific administration endpoint daemon(s) at the receiving nodes. Reception of a custody signal terminates the custodial re-forwarding timers for all bundles acknowledged in that signal; the re-forwarding of bundles upon custodial re-forwarding timer expiration is initiated by the <b>bpclock</b> daemon.</p>

<p><b>bibeclo</b> is spawned automatically by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to the &#39;s&#39; (START) command that starts operation of the Bundle Protocol, and it is terminated by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to an &#39;x&#39; (STOP) command. <b>bibeclo</b> can also be spawned and terminated in response to START and STOP commands that pertain specifically to the BIBE convergence layer protocol.</p>

<h1 id="EXIT-STATUS">EXIT STATUS</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="pod0">&quot;0&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bibeclo</b> terminated normally, for reasons noted in the <b>ion.log</b> file. If this termination was not commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file and use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart <b>bibeclo</b>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod1">&quot;1&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>bibeclo</b> terminated abnormally, for reasons noted in the <b>ion.log</b> file. Investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file, then use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart <b>bibeclo</b>.</p>
