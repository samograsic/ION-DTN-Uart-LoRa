<p>bssprc - Bundle Streaming Service Protocol management commands file</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>BSSP management commands are passed to <b>bsspadmin</b> either in a file of text lines or interactively at <b>bsspadmin</b>&#39;s command prompt (:). Commands are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line. The formats and effects of the BSSP management commands are described below.</p>

<h1 id="COMMANDS">COMMANDS</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="pod"><b>?</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>help</b> command. This will display a listing of the commands and their formats. It is the same as the <b>h</b> command.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod1"><b>#</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Comment line. Lines beginning with <b>#</b> are not interpreted.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="e-1-0"><b>e</b> { 1 | 0 }</dt>
<dd>

<p>Echo control. Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by bsspadmin to be logged as well as sent to stdout. Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="v"><b>v</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Version number. Prints out the version of ION currently installed. HINT: combine with <b>e 1</b> command to log the version number at startup.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="est_max_nbr_of_sessions"><b>1</b> <i>est_max_nbr_of_sessions</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>initialize</b> command. Until this command is executed, BSSP is not in operation on the local ION node and most <i>bsspadmin</i> commands will fail.</p>

<p>The command uses <i>est_max_nbr_of_sessions</i> to configure the hashtable it will use to manage access to transmission sessions that are currently in progress. For optimum performance, <i>est_max_nbr_of_sessions</i> should normally equal or exceed the summation of <i>max_nbr_of_sessions</i> over all spans as discussed below.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="a-span-peer_engine_nbr-max_nbr_of_sessions-max_block_size-BE-BSO_command-RL-BSO_command-queuing_latency"><b>a span</b> <i>peer_engine_nbr</i> <i>max_nbr_of_sessions</i> <i>max_block_size</i> &#39;<i>BE-BSO_command</i>&#39; &#39;<i>RL-BSO_command</i> [<i>queuing_latency</i>]</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>add span</b> command. This command declares that a <i>span</i> of potential BSSP data interchange exists between the local BSSP engine and the indicated (neighboring) BSSP engine.</p>

<p>The <i>max_block_size</i> is expressed as a number of bytes of data. <i>max_block_size</i> is used to configure transmission buffer sizes; as such, it limits client data item size.</p>

<p><i>max_nbr_of__sessions</i> constitutes, in effect, the local BSSP engine&#39;s retransmission &quot;window&quot; for this span. The retransmission windows of the spans impose flow control on BSSP transmission, reducing the chance ofx allocation of all available space in the ION node&#39;s data store to BSSP transmission sessions.</p>

<p><i>BE-BSO_command</i> is script text that will be executed when BSSP is started on this node, to initiate operation of the best-efforts transmission channel task for this span. Note that &quot; <i>peer_engine_nbr</i>&quot; will automatically be appended to <i>BE-BSO_command</i> by <b>bsspadmin</b> before the command is executed, so only the link-service-specific portion of the command should be provided in the <i>LSO_command</i> string itself.</p>

<p><i>RL-BSO_command</i> is script text that will be executed when BSSP is started on this node, to initiate operation of the reliable transmission channel task for this span. Note that &quot; <i>peer_engine_nbr</i>&quot; will automatically be appended to <i>RL-BSO_command</i> by <b>bsspadmin</b> before the command is executed, so only the link-service-specific portion of the command should be provided in the <i>LSO_command</i> string itself.</p>

<p><i>queuing_latency</i> is the estimated number of seconds that we expect to lapse between reception of a block at this node and transmission of an acknowledging PDU, due to processing delay in the node. (See the &#39;m ownqtime&#39; command below.) The default value is 1.</p>

<p>If <i>queuing latency</i> a negative number, the absolute value of this number is used as the actual queuing latency and session purging is enabled; otherwise session purging is disabled. If session purging is enabled for a span then at the end of any period of transmission over this span all of the span&#39;s export sessions that are currently in progress are automatically canceled. Notionally this forces re-forwarding of the DTN bundles in each session&#39;s block, to avoid having to wait for the restart of transmission on this span before those bundles can be successfully transmitted.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="a-seat-BE-BSO_command-RL-BSO_command"><b>a seat</b> &#39;<i>BE-BSO_command</i>&#39; &#39;<i>RL-BSO_command</i>&#39;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>add seat</b> command. This command declares that the local BSSP engine can receive BSSP PDUs via the link service input daemons that begin running when &#39;<i>BE-BSO_command</i>&#39; and &#39;<i>RL-BSO_command</i>&#39; are executed.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="c-span-peer_engine_nbr-max_nbr_of_sessions-max_block_size-BE-BSO_command-RL-BSO_command-queuing_latency"><b>c span</b> <i>peer_engine_nbr</i> <i>max_nbr_of_sessions</i> <i>max_block_size</i> &#39;<i>BE-BSO_command</i>&#39; &#39;<i>RL-BSO_command</i> [<i>queuing_latency</i>]</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>change span</b> command. This command sets the indicated span&#39;s configuration parameters to the values provided as arguments.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="d-span-peer_engine_nbr"><b>d span</b> <i>peer_engine_nbr</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>delete span</b> command. This command deletes the span identified by <i>peer_engine_nbr</i>. The command will fail if any outbound blocks for this span are pending transmission.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="d-seat-BE-BSO_command-RL-BSO_command"><b>d seat</b> &#39;<i>BE-BSO_command</i>&#39; &#39;<i>RL-BSO_command</i>&#39;</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>delete span</b> command. This command deletes the seat identified by &#39;<i>BE-BSO_command</i>&#39; and &#39;<i>RL-BSO_command</i>&#39;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="i-span-peer_engine_nbr"><b>i span</b> <i>peer_engine_nbr</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>This command will print information (all configuration parameters) about the span identified by <i>peer_engine_nbr</i>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="i-seat-BE-BSO_command-RL-BSO_command"><b>i seat</b> &#39;<i>BE-BSO_command</i>&#39; &#39;<i>RL-BSO_command</i>&#39;</dt>
<dd>

<p>This command will print all information (i.e., process ID numbers) about the seat identified by &#39;<i>BE-BSO_command</i>&#39; and &#39;<i>RL-BSO_command</i>&#39;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="l-span"><b>l span</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>This command lists all declared BSSP data interchange spans.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="l-seat"><b>l seat</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>This command lists all declared BSSP data acquisition seats.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="s-BE-BSI_command-RL-BSI_command"><b>s</b> [&#39;<i>BE-BSI_command</i>&#39; &#39;<i>RL-BSI_command</i>&#39;]</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>start</b> command. This command starts reliable and best-efforts link service output tasks for all BSSP spans (to remote engines) from the local BSSP engine, and it starts the reliable and best-efforts link service input tasks for the local engine. &#39;<i>BE-BSI_command</i>&#39; and &#39;<i>RL-BSI_command</i>&#39; are deprecated but are supported for backward compatibility; if provided, the effect is the same as entering the command &quot;a seat &#39;<i>BE-BSO_command</i>&#39; &#39;<i>RL-BSO_command</i>&#39;&quot; prior to starting all daemon tasks.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="m-ownqtime-own_queuing_latency"><b>m ownqtime</b> <i>own_queuing_latency</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>manage own queuing time</b> command. This command sets the number of seconds of predicted additional latency attributable to processing delay within the local engine itself that should be included whenever BSSP computes the nominal round-trip time for an exchange of data with any remote engine. The default value is 1.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="x"><b>x</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>stop</b> command. This command stops all link service input and output tasks for the local BSSP engine.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="w-0-1-activity_spec"><b>w</b> { 0 | 1 | &lt;activity_spec&gt; }</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>BSSP watch</b> command. This command enables and disables production of a continuous stream of user-selected BSSP activity indication characters. A watch parameter of &quot;1&quot; selects all BSSP activity indication characters; &quot;0&quot; de-selects all BSSP activity indication characters; any other <i>activity_spec</i> such as &quot;df=&quot; selects all activity indication characters in the string, de-selecting all others. BSSP will print each selected activity indication character to <b>stdout</b> every time a processing event of the associated type occurs:</p>

<p><b>d</b> bssp send completed</p>

<p><b>e</b> bssp block constructed for issuance</p>

<p><b>f</b> bssp block issued</p>

<p><b>g</b> bssp block popped from best-efforts transmission queue</p>

<p><b>h</b> positive ACK received for bssp block, session ended</p>

<p><b>s</b> bssp block received</p>

<p><b>t</b> bssp block popped from reliable transmission queue</p>

<p><b>=</b> unacknowledged best-efforts block requeued for reliable transmission</p>

<p><b>{</b> session canceled locally by sender</p>

</dd>
<dt id="h"><b>h</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>help</b> command. This will display a listing of the commands and their formats. It is the same as the <b>?</b> command.</p>
