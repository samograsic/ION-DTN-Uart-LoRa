<p>dtpcd - DTPC daemon task for receiving and processing DTPC ADUs in bundles</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>dtpcd</b></p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><b>dtpcd</b> is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that manages the reception and processing of DTPC protocol data units. It receives the payloads of bundles destined for the &quot;ipn&quot;-scheme endpoint whose node number is the number of the local node and whose service number is the DTPC_RECV_SVC_NBR (129 as of the time of this writeng).</p>

<p>DTPC protocol data units are of two types: application data units (ADUs, i.e., aggregations of application data items) and acknowledgments. Each acknowledgment is interpreted as authorization to release the buffer space occupied by the node&#39;s local copy of the acknowledged ADU. Each ADU is parsed into its constituent application data items, which are then delivered to the applications awaiting them, and when required a DTPC end-to-end acknowledgment PDU is returned to the DTPC PDU sender.</p>
