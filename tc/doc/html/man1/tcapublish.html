<p>tcapublish - Trusted Collective authority task that publishes consensus critical information bulletins</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>tcapublish</b> <i>blocks_group_number</i></p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><b>tcapublish</b> is a background task that completes the processing of a single iteration of the bulletin publication cycle for the collective authority function of the TC application identified by <i>blocks_group_number</i> on the local node. To do so, it receives proposed bulletins multicast by <b>tcacompile</b> daemons, resolves differences among the received bulletins to arrive at a consensus bulletin, computes a hash for the consensus bulletin, erasure-codes the consensus bulletin, and multicasts that subset of the resulting code blocks that is allocated to the local node according to the local node&#39;s assigned position in the authority array of the application&#39;s collective authority. It is spawned automatically by the local node&#39;s <b>tcacompile</b> daemon for the indicated application, at the time that daemon publishes its own proposed bulletin for this iteration of the bulletin compilation cycle; it terminates immediately after it has finished publishing code blocks.</p>
