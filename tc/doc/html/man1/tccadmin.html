<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>tccadmin - DTKA node administration interface</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>tccadmin</b> <i>blocks_group_number</i> [ <i>commands_filename</i> | . | ! ]</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><b>tccadmin</b> configures and manages the Trusted Collecive client databases for TC applications on the local ION node, enabling the node to utilize the services of one or more collective authorities.</p>

<p>The first command-line argument to <b>tccadmin</b> is <i>blocksGroupNumber</i>, which identifies the specific TC application to which all commands submitted to this instance of <b>tccadmin</b> will apply. A TC application is uniquely identified by the group number of the Bundle Protocol multicast group comprising all nodes hosting TC clients that subscribe to TC &quot;blocks&quot; published for that application.</p>

<p><b>tccadmin</b> configures and manages a TC client database in response to client configuration commands found in <i>commands_filename</i>, if provided; if not, <b>tccadmin</b> prints a simple prompt (:) so that the user may type commands directly into standard input. If commands_filename is a period (.), the effect is the same as if a command file containing the single command &#39;x&#39; were passed to tccadmin -- that is, all of the TC application&#39;s daemon tasks are stopped. If commands_filename is an exclamation point (!), that effect is reversed: the TC application&#39;s daemon tasks are restarted.</p>

<p>The format of commands for <i>commands_filename</i> can be queried from <b>tccadmin</b> by entering the command &#39;h&#39; or &#39;?&#39; at the prompt. The commands are documented in tccrc(5).</p>

<h1 id="EXIT-STATUS">EXIT STATUS</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="pod0">&quot;0&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p>Successful completion of TC client administration.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="tccadmin">tccadmin</dt>
<dd>

<p>Enter interactive TC client administration command entry mode.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="tccadmin-host1.karc">tccadmin host1.karc</dt>
<dd>

<p>Execute all configuration commands in <i>host1.karc</i>, then terminate immediately.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="FILES">FILES</h1>

<p>Status and diagnostic messages from <b>tccadmin</b> and from other software that utilizes the ION node are nominally written to a log file in the current working directory within which <b>tccadmin</b> was run. The log file is typically named <b>ion.log</b>.</p>

<p>See also tccrc(5).</p>

<h1 id="ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</h1>

<p>No environment variables apply.</p>

<h1 id="DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</h1>

<p><b>Note</b>: all ION administration utilities expect source file input to be lines of ASCII text that are NL-delimited. If you edit the tccrc file on a Windows machine, be sure to <b>use dos2unix to convert it to Unix text format</b> before presenting it to <b>tccadmin</b>. Otherwise <b>tccadmin</b> will detect syntax errors and will not function satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The following diagnostics may be issued to the log file:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Cant-open-command-file">Can&#39;t open command file...</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <i>commands_filename</i> specified in the command line doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>Various errors that don&#39;t cause <b>tccadmin</b> to fail but are noted in the log file may be caused by improperly formatted commands given at the prompt or in the <i>commands_filename</i>. Please see tccrc(5) for details.</p>
