<p>ltpmeter - LTP daemon task for aggregating and segmenting transmission blocks</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>ltpmeter</b> <i>remote_engine_nbr</i></p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><b>ltpmeter</b> is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that manages the presentation of LTP segments to link service output tasks. Each &quot;span&quot; of LTP data interchange between the local LTP engine and a neighboring LTP engine requires its own <b>ltpmeter</b> task. All <b>ltpmeter</b> tasks are spawned automatically by <b>ltpadmin</b> in response to the &#39;s&#39; command that starts operation of the LTP protocol, and they are all terminated by <b>ltpadmin</b> in response to an &#39;x&#39; (STOP) command.</p>

<p><b>ltpmeter</b> waits until its span&#39;s current transmission block (the data to be transmitted during the transmission session that is currently being constructed) is ready for transmission, then divides the data in the span&#39;s block buffer into segments and enqueues the segments for transmission by the span&#39;s link service output task (giving the segments semaphore to unblock the link service output task as necessary), then reinitializes the span&#39;s block buffer and starts another session (giving the &quot;buffer empty&quot; semaphore to unblock the client service task -- nominally <b>ltpclo</b>, the LTP convergence layer output task for Bundle Protocol -- as necessary).</p>

<p><b>ltpmeter</b> determines that the current transmission block is ready for transmission by waiting until either (a) the aggregate size of all service data units in the block&#39;s buffer exceeds the aggregation size limit for this span or (b) the length of time that the first service data unit in the block&#39;s buffer has been awaiting transmission exceeds the aggregation time limit for this span. The &quot;buffer full&quot; semaphore is given when ION (either the ltp_send() function or the <b>ltpclock</b> daemon) determines that one of these conditions is true; <b>ltpmeter</b> simply waits for this semaphore to be given.</p>

<p>The initiation of a new session may also be blocked: the total number of transmission sessions that the local LTP engine may have open at a single time is limited (this is LTP flow control), and while the engine is at this limit no new sessions can be started. Availability of a session from the session pool is signaled by the &quot;session&quot; semaphore, which is given whenever a session is completed or canceled.</p>
