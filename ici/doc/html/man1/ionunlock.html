<p>ionunlock - utility for unlocking a locked ION node</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>ionunlock</b> [<i>sdr_name</i>]</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The <b>ionunlock</b> program is designed to be run when some ION thread has terminated while it is the owner of the node&#39;s system mutex, i.e., while in the midst of an SDR transaction. IT MUST NEVER BE RUN AT ANY OTHER TIME as it will totally corrupt a node that is not locked up. The program simply declares itself to be the owner of the incomplete transaction and cancels it, enabling the rest of the system to resume operations.</p>

<p>If omitted, <i>sdr_name</i> defaults to &quot;ion&quot;.</p>

<h1 id="EXIT-STATUS">EXIT STATUS</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="pod0">&quot;0&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>ionunlock</b> has terminated successfully.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod1">&quot;1&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>ionunlock</b> has terminated unsuccessfully. See diagnostic messages in the <b>ion.log</b> log file for details.</p>

<h1 id="DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</h1>

<p>The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Cant-initialize-the-SDR-system">Can&#39;t initialize the SDR system.</dt>
<dd>

<p>Probable operations error: ION appears not to be initialized, in which case there is no point in running <b>ionunlock</b>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Cant-start-using-SDR">Can&#39;t start using SDR.</dt>
<dd>

<p>ION system error. See earlier diagnostic messages posted to <b>ion.log</b> for details. In this event it is unlikely that <b>ionunlock</b> can be run successfully, and it is also unlikely that it would have any effect if it did run successfully.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="ionunlock-unnecessary-exiting">ionunlock unnecessary; exiting.</dt>
<dd>

<p>Either the indicated SDR is not initialized or it is not currently stuck in a transaction.</p>

</dd>
