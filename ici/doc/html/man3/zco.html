<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>&quot;Zero-copy objects&quot; (ZCOs) are abstract data access representations designed to minimize I/O in the encapsulation of application source data within one or more layers of communication protocol structure. ZCOs are constructed within the heap space of an SDR to which implementations of all layers of the stack must have access. Each ZCO contains information enabling access to the source data objects, together with (a) a linked list of zero or more &quot;extents&quot; that reference portions of these source data objects and (b) linked lists of protocol header and trailer capsules that have been explicitly attached to the ZCO since its creation. The concatenation of the headers (in ascending stack sequence), source data object extents, and trailers (in descending stack sequence) is what is to be transmitted or has been received.</p>

<p>Each source data object may be either a file (identified by pathname stored in a &quot;file reference&quot; object in SDR heap) or an item in mass storage (identified by item number, with implementation-specific semantics, stored in a &quot;bulk reference&quot; object in SDR heap) or an object in SDR heap space (identified by heap address stored in an &quot;object reference&quot; object in SDR heap) or an array of bytes in SDR heap space (identified by heap address). Each protocol header or trailer capsule indicates the length and the address (within SDR heap space) of a single protocol header or trailer at some layer of the stack. Note that the source data object for each ZCO extent is specified indirectly, by reference to a content lien reference structure that refers to a heap space object, mass storage item, or file; the reference structures contain the actual locations of the source data together with reference counts, enabling any number of &quot;clones&quot; of a given ZCO extent to be constructed without consuming additional resources. These reference counts ensure that the reference structures and the source data items they refer to are deleted automatically when (and only when) all ZCO extents that reference them have been deleted.</p>

<p>Note that the safety of shared access to a ZCO is protected by the fact that the ZCO resides in SDR heap space and therefore cannot be modified other than in the course of an SDR transaction, which serializes access. Moreover, extraction of data from a ZCO may entail the reading of file-based source data extents, which may cause file progress to be updated in one or more file reference objects in the SDR heap. For this reason, all ZCO &quot;transmit&quot; and &quot;receive&quot; functions must be performed within SDR transactions.</p>

<p>Note also that ZCO can more broadly be used as a general-purpose reference counting system for non-volatile data objects, where a need for such a system is identified.</p>

<p>The total volume of file system space, mass storage space, and SDR heap space that may be occupied by inbound and (separately) outbound ZCO extents are system configuration parameters that may be set by ZCO library functions. Those limits are enforced when extents are appended to ZCOs: total inbound and outbound ZCO file space, mass storage, and SDR heap occupancy are updated continuously as ZCOs are created and destroyed, and the formation of a new extent is prohibited when the length of the extent exceeds the difference between the applicable limit and the corresponding current occupancy total. Doing separate accounting for inbound and outbound ZCOs enables inbound ZCOs to be formed (for data reception purposes) even when the total current volume of outbound ZCOs has reached its limit, and vice versa.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="void-zco_register_callback-ZcoCallback-notify">void zco_register_callback(ZcoCallback notify)</dt>
<dd>

<p>This function registers the &quot;callback&quot; function that the ZCO system will invoke every time a ZCO is destroyed, making ZCO file, bulk, and/or heap space available for the formation of new ZCO extents. This mechanism can be used, for example, to notify tasks that are waiting for ZCO space to be made available so that they can resume some communication protocol procedure.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-zco_unregister_callback">void zco_unregister_callback( )</dt>
<dd>

<p>This function simply unregisters the currently registered callback function for ZCO destruction.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Object-zco_create_file_ref-Sdr-sdr-char-pathName-char-cleanupScript-ZcoAcct-acct">Object zco_create_file_ref(Sdr sdr, char *pathName, char *cleanupScript, ZcoAcct acct)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Creates and returns a new file reference object, which can be used as the source data extent location for creating a ZCO whose source data object is the file identified by <i>pathName</i>. <i>cleanupScript</i>, if not NULL, is invoked at the moment the last ZCO that cites this file reference is destroyed [normally upon delivery either down to the &quot;ZCO transition layer&quot; of the protocol stack or up to a ZCO-capable application]. A zero-length string is interpreted as implicit direction to delete the referenced file when the file reference object is destroyed. Maximum length of <i>cleanupScript</i> is 255. <i>acct</i> must be ZcoInbound or ZcoOutbound, depending on whether the first ZCO that will reference this object will be inbound or outbound. Returns SDR location of file reference object on success, 0 on any error.</p>

<dd>

<p>Changes the <i>pathName</i> and <i>cleanupScript</i> of the indicated file reference. The new values of these fields are validated as for zco_create_file_ref(). Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.</p>

<dd>

<p>If the file reference object residing at location <i>fileRef</i> within the indicated Sdr is no longer in use (no longer referenced by any ZCO), destroys this file reference object immediately. Otherwise, flags this file reference object for destruction as soon as the last reference to it is removed.</p>

<dd>

<p>Creates and returns a new bulk reference object, which can be used as the source data extent location for creating a ZCO whose source data object is the mass storage item of length <i>length</i> identified by <i>item</i> (the semantics of which are implementation-dependent). Note that the referenced item is automatically destroyed at the time that the last ZCO that cites this bulk reference is destroyed (normally upon delivery either down to the &quot;ZCO transition layer&quot; of the protocol stack or up to a ZCO-capable application). <i>acct</i> must be ZcoInbound or ZcoOutbound, depending on whether the first ZCO that will reference this object will be inbound or outbound.

<dd>

<p>Creates and returns a new object reference object, which can be used as the source data extent location for creating a ZCO whose source data object is the SDR heap object of length <i>length</i> identified by <i>object</i>. Note that the referenced object is automatically freed at the time that the last ZCO that cites this object reference is destroyed (normally upon delivery either down to the &quot;ZCO transition layer&quot; of the protocol stack or up to a ZCO-capable application). <i>acct</i> must be ZcoInbound or ZcoOutbound, depending on whether the first ZCO that will reference this object will be inbound or outbound.

<dd>

<p>If the object reference object residing at location <i>objRef</i> within the indicated Sdr is no longer in use (no longer referenced by any ZCO), destroys this object reference object immediately.

If <i>offset</i> isn&#39;t the start of an extent or <i>offset + length</i> isn&#39;t the end of an extent, returns -1 in all three fields.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Object-zco_create-Sdr-sdr-ZcoMedium-firstExtentSourceMedium-Object-firstExtentLocation-vast-firstExtentOffset-vast-firstExtentLength-ZcoAcct-acct">Object zco_create(Sdr sdr, ZcoMedium firstExtentSourceMedium, Object firstExtentLocation, vast firstExtentOffset, vast firstExtentLength, ZcoAcct acct)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Creates a new inbound or outbound ZCO. <i>firstExtentLocation</i> and <i>firstExtentLength</i> must either both be zero (indicating that zco_append_extent() will be used to insert the first source data extent later) or else both be non-zero. If <i>firstExtentLocation</i> is non-zero, then (a) <i>firstExtentLocation</i> must be the SDR location of a file reference object, bulk reference object, object reference object, SDR heap object, or ZCO, depending on the value of <i>firstExtentSourceMedium</i>, and (b) <i>firstExtentOffset</i> indicates how many leading bytes of the source data object should be skipped over when adding the initial source data extent to the new ZCO. A negative value for <i>firstExtentLength</i> indicates that the extent is already known not to be too large for the available ZCO space, and the actual length of the extent is the additive inverse of this value. On success, returns the SDR location of the new ZCO. Returns 0 if there is insufficient ZCO space for creation of the new ZCO; returns ((Object) -1) on any error.</p>

<dd>

<p>Appends the indicated source data extent to the indicated ZCO, as described for zco_create(). Both the <i>location</i> and <i>length</i> of the source data must be non-zero. A negative value for <i>length</i> indicates that the extent is already known not to be too large for the available ZCO space, and the actual length of the extent is the additive inverse of this value. For constraints on the value of <i>location</i>, see zco_create(). Returns <i>length</i> on success, 0 if there is insufficient ZCO space for creation of the new source data extent, -1 on any error.</p>

<dd>

<p>These functions attach and remove the ZCO&#39;s headers and trailers. <i>header</i> and <i>trailer</i> are assumed to be arrays of octets, not necessarily text. Attaching a header or trailer causes it to be written to the SDR. The prepend and append functions return 0 on success, -1 on any error.</p>

<dd>

<p>Skips over the first <i>skip</i> headers of <i>zco</i> and returns the address of the text of the next header, placing the length of the header&#39;s text in <i>*length</i>. Returns 0 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Object-zco_trailer_text-Sdr-sdr-Object-zco-int-skip-vast-length">Object zco_trailer_text(Sdr sdr, Object zco, int skip, vast *length)</dt>

<p>Skips over the first <i>skip</i> trailers of <i>zco</i> and returns the address of the text of the next trailer, placing the length of the trailer&#39;s text in <i>*length</i>. Returns 0 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-zco_destroy-Sdr-sdr-Object-zco">void zco_destroy(Sdr sdr, Object zco)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Destroys the indicated Zco. This reduces the reference counts for all files and SDR objects referenced in the ZCO&#39;s extents, resulting in the freeing of SDR objects and (optionally) the deletion of files as those reference count drop to zero.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-zco_bond-Sdr-sdr-Object-zco">void zco_bond(Sdr sdr, Object zco)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Converts all headers and trailers of the indicated Zco to source data extents. Use this function to ensure that known header and trailer data are included when the ZCO is cloned.</p>

</dd>

<p>Writes the contents of <i>buffer</i>, for length <i>length</i>, into <i>zco</i> at offset <i>offset</i>. Returns 0 on success, -1 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Object-zco_clone-Sdr-sdr-Object-zco-vast-offset-vast-length">Object zco_clone(Sdr sdr, Object zco, vast offset, vast length)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Creates a new ZCO whose source data is a copy of a subset of the source data of the referenced ZCO. This procedure is required whenever it is necessary to process the ZCO&#39;s source data in multiple different ways, for different purposes, and therefore the ZCO must be in multiple states at the same time. Portions of the source data extents of the original ZCO are copied as necessary, but no header or trailer capsules are copied. Returns SDR location of the new ZCO on success, (Object) -1 on any error.</p>

<dd>

<p>Appends to <i>toZco</i> a copy of a subset of the source data of <i>fromZCO</i>. Portions of the source data extents of <i>fromZCO</i> are copied as necessary. Returns total data length cloned, or -1 on any error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="vast-zco_length-Sdr-sdr-Object-zco">vast zco_length(Sdr sdr, Object zco)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Returns length of entire ZCO, including all headers and trailers and all source data extents. This is the size of the object that would be formed by concatenating the text of all headers, trailers, and source data extents into a single serialized object.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="vast-zco_source_data_length-Sdr-sdr-Object-zco">vast zco_source_data_length(Sdr sdr, Object zco)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Returns length of entire ZCO minus the lengths of all attached header and trailer capsules. This is the size of the object that would be formed by concatenating the text of all source data extents (including those that are presumed to contain header or trailer text attached elsewhere) into a single serialized object.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="ZcoAcct-zco_acct-Sdr-sdr-Object-zco">ZcoAcct zco_acct(Sdr sdr, Object zco)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Returns an indicator as to whether <i>zco</i> is inbound or outbound.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-zco_start_transmitting-Object-zco-ZcoReader-reader">void zco_start_transmitting(Object zco, ZcoReader *reader)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Used by underlying protocol layer to start extraction of an outbound ZCO&#39;s bytes (both from header and trailer capsules and from source data extents) for &quot;transmission&quot; -- i.e., the copying of bytes into a memory buffer for delivery to some non-ZCO-aware protocol implementation. Initializes reading at the first byte of the total concatenated ZCO object. Populates <i>reader</i>, which is used to keep track of &quot;transmission&quot; progress via this ZCO reference.</p>

<p>Note that this function can be called multiple times to restart reading at the start of the ZCO. Note also that multiple ZcoReader objects may be used concurrently, by the same task or different tasks, to advance through the ZCO independently.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-zco_track_file_offset-ZcoReader-reader">void zco_track_file_offset(ZcoReader *reader)</dt>

<dt id="vast-zco_transmit-Sdr-sdr-ZcoReader-reader-vast-length-char-buffer">vast zco_transmit(Sdr sdr, ZcoReader *reader, vast length, char *buffer)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Copies <i>length</i> as-yet-uncopied bytes of the total concatenated ZCO (referenced by <i>reader</i>) into <i>buffer</i>. If <i>buffer</i> is NULL, skips over <i>length</i> bytes without copying. Returns the number of bytes copied (or skipped) on success, 0 on any file access error, -1 on any other error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-zco_start_receiving-Object-zco-ZcoReader-reader">void zco_start_receiving(Object zco, ZcoReader *reader)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Used by overlying protocol layer to start extraction of an inbound ZCO&#39;s bytes for &quot;reception&quot; -- i.e., the copying of bytes into a memory buffer for delivery to a protocol header parser, to a protocol trailer parser, or to the ultimate recipient (application). Initializes reading of headers, source data, and trailers at the first byte of the concatenated ZCO objects. Populates <i>reader</i>, which is used to keep track of &quot;reception&quot; progress via this ZCO reference and is required.</p>

<dd>

<p>Copies <i>length</i> as-yet-uncopied bytes of presumptive protocol header text from ZCO source data extents into <i>buffer</i>. If <i>buffer</i> is NULL, skips over <i>length</i> bytes without copying. Returns number of bytes copied (or skipped) on success, 0 on any file access error, -1 on any other error.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-zco_delimit_source-Sdr-sdr-Object-zco-vast-offset-vast-length">void zco_delimit_source(Sdr sdr, Object zco, vast offset, vast length)</dt>
<dd>

<p>Sets the computed offset and length of actual source data in the ZCO, thereby implicitly establishing the total length of the ZCO&#39;s concatenated protocol headers as <i>offset</i> and the location of the ZCO&#39;s innermost protocol trailer as the sum of <i>offset</i> and <i>length</i>. Offset and length are typically determined from the information carried in received presumptive protocol header text.</p>

<dd>

<p>Copies <i>length</i> as-yet-uncopied bytes of source data from ZCO extents into <i>buffer</i>. If <i>buffer</i> is NULL, skips over <i>length</i> bytes without copying. Returns number of bytes copied (or skipped) on success, 0 on any file access error, -1 on any other error.</p>

<dd>

<p>Deletes all source data extents that contain only header or trailer data and adjusts the offsets and/or lengths of all remaining extents to exclude any known header or trailer data. This function is useful when handling a ZCO that was received from an underlying protocol layer rather than from an overlying application or protocol layer; use it before starting the transmission of the ZCO to another node or before enqueuing it for reception by an overlying application or protocol layer.</p>
