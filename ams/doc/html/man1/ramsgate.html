<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>ramsgate - Remote AMS gateway daemon</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p><b>ramsgate</b> <i>application_name</i> <i>authority_name</i> [<i>bundles_TTL</i>]</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><b>ramsgate</b> is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that functions as a Remote AMS gateway. <i>application_name</i> and <i>authority_name</i> must identify an AMS venture that is known to operate in the local continuum, as noted in the MIB for the <b>ramsgate</b> application module.</p>

<p><b>ramsgate</b> will register as an application module in the root unit of the indicated venture, so a configuration server for the local continuum and a registrar for the root unit of the indicated venture (which may both be instantiated in a single <b>amsd</b> daemon task) must be running in order for <b>ramsgate</b> to commence operations.</p>

<p><b>ramsgate</b> with communicate with other RAMS gateway modules in other continua by means of the RAMS network protocol noted in the RAMS gateway endpoint ID for the local continuum, as identified (explicitly or implicitly) in the MIB.</p>

<p>If the RAMS network protocol is &quot;bp&quot; (i.e., the DTN Bundle Protocol), then an ION Bundle Protocol node must be operating on the local computer and that node must be registered in the BP endpoint identified by the RAMS gateway endpoint ID for the local continuum. Moreover, in this case the value of <i>bundles_TTL</i> - if specified - will be taken as the lifetime in seconds that is to be declared for all &quot;bundles&quot; issued by <b>ramsgate</b>; <i>bundles_TTL</i> defaults to 86400 seconds (one day) if omitted.</p>

<h1 id="EXIT-STATUS">EXIT STATUS</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="pod0">&quot;0&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>ramsgate</b> terminated normally.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod1">&quot;1&quot;</dt>
<dd>

<p><b>ramsgate</b> failed, for reasons noted in the ion.log file; the task terminated.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="FILES">FILES</h1>

<p>A MIB initialization file with the applicable default name (see amsrc(5)) must be present.</p>

<p><b>ramsgate</b> records all &quot;petitions&quot; (requests for data on behalf of AMS modules in other continua) in a file named &quot;petition.log&quot;. At startup, the <b>ramsgate</b> daemon automatically reads and processes all petitions in the petition.log file just as if they were received in real time. <b>Note</b> that this means that you can cause petitions to be, in effect, &quot;pre-received&quot; by simply editing this file prior to startup. This can be an especially effective way to configure a RAMS network in which long signal propagation times would otherwise retard real-time petitioning and thus delay the onset of fully functional message exchange.</p>

<h1 id="ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</h1>

<p>No environment variables apply.</p>

<h1 id="DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</h1>

<p>The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="ramsgate-cant-run">ramsgate can&#39;t run.</dt>
<dd>

<p>RAMS gateway functionality failed, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="BUGS">BUGS</h1>

<p>Note that the AMS design principle of receiving messages immediately and enqueuing them for eventual ingestion by the application module - rather than imposing application-layer flow control on AMS message traffic - enables high performance but makes <b>ramsgate</b> vulnerable to message spikes. Since production and transmission of bundles is typically slower than AMS message reception over TCP service, the ION working memory and/or heap space available for AMS event insertion and/or bundle production can be quickly exhausted if a high rate of application message production is sustained for a long enough time. Mechanisms for defending against this sort of failure are under study, but for now the best mitigations are simply to (a) build with compiler option -DAMS_INDUSTRIAL=1, (b) allocate as much space as possible to ION working memory and SDR heap (see ionconfig(5)) and (c) limit the rate of AMS message issuance.</p>
