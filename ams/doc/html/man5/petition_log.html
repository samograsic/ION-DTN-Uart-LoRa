<p>petition.log - Remote AMS petition log</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The Remote AMS daemon <b>ramsgate</b> records all &quot;petitions&quot; (requests for data on behalf of AMS modules in other continua) in a file named <b>petition.log</b>. At startup, the <b>ramsgate</b> daemon automatically reads and processes all petitions in the <b>petition.log</b> file just as if they were received in real time, to re-establish the petition state that was in effect at the time the <b>ramsgate</b> daemon shut down. Note that this means that you can cause petitions to be, in effect, &quot;pre-received&quot; by simply editing this file prior to startup. This can be an especially effective way to configure a RAMS network in which long signal propagation times would otherwise retard real-time petitioning and thus delay the onset of fully functional message exchange.</p>

<p>Entries in <b>petition.log</b> are simple ASCII text lines, with parameters separated by spaces. Each line of <b>petition.log</b> has the following parameters:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="protocolId">protocolId</dt>
<dd>

<p>This is a number that identifies the RAMS network protocol characterizing the network on which the petition was received: 1 == DTN Bundle Protocol, 2 = UDP.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="gatewayID">gatewayID</dt>
<dd>

<p>This is a string that identifies the remote RAMS gateway node that issued this petition.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="controlCode">controlCode</dt>
<dd>

<p>This is a number that indicates whether the petition described by this line is one that is being asserted (2) or canceled (3).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="subject">subject</dt>
<dd>

<p>A number that identifies the subject of the traffic to which the petition pertains.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="continuumNumber">continuumNumber</dt>
<dd>

<p>Identifies the continuum for the domain of the petition.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="unitNumber">unitNumber</dt>
<dd>

<p>Identifies the unit for the domain of the petition.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="roleNumber">roleNumber</dt>
<dd>

<p>Identifies the role for the domain of the petition.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
