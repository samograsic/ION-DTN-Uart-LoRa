<p>amsrc - CCSDS Asynchronous Message Service MIB initialization file</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The Management Information Base (MIB) for an AMS communicating entity (either <b>amsd</b> or an AMS application module) must contain enough information to enable the entity to initiate participation in AMS message exchange, such as the network location of the configuration server and the roles and message subjects defined for some venture.</p>

<p>AMS entities automatically load their MIBs from initialization files at startup. When AMS is built with the -DNOEXPAT compiler option set, the MIB initialization file must conform to the <i>amsrc</i> syntax described below; otherwise the <i>expat</i> XML parsing library must be linked into the AMS executable and the MIB initialization file must conform to the <i>amsxml</i> syntax described in amsxml(5).</p>

<p>The MIB initialization file lists <i>elements</i> of MIB update information, each of which may have one or more <i>attributes</i>. An element may also have sub-elements that are listed within the declaration of the parent element, and so on.</p>

<p>The declaration of an element may occupy a single line of text in the MIB initialization file or may extend across multiple lines. A single-line element declaration is indicated by a &#39;*&#39; in the first character of the line. The beginning of a multi-line element declaration is indicated by a &#39;+&#39; in the first character of the line, while the end of that declaration is indicated by a &#39;-&#39; in the first character of the line. In every case, the type of element must be indicated by an element-type name beginning in the second character of the line and terminated by whitespace. Every start-of-element line <b>must</b> be matched by a subsequent end-of-element line that precedes the start of any other element that is not a nested sub-element of this element.</p>

<p>Attributes are represented by whitespace-terminated &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; expressions immediately following the element-type name on a &#39;*&#39; or &#39;+&#39; line. An attribute value that contains whitespace must be enclosed within a pair of single-quote (&#39;) characters.</p>

<p>Two types of elements are recognized in the MIB initialization file: control elements and configuration elements. A control element establishes the update context within which the configuration elements nested within it are processed, while a configuration element declares values for one or more items of AMS configuration information in the MIB.</p>

<p>Note that an aggregate configuration element (i.e., one which may contain other interior configuration elements; venture, for example) may be presented outside of any control element, simply to establish the context in which subsequent control elements are to be interpreted.</p>

<dd>

<p>Normally the specifications of the transport service endpoints at which an AMS application module can receive messages are computed automatically using standard transport-service-specific rules.
